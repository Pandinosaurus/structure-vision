This is just a test application for [streamlit-pdf-viewer](https://github.com/lfoppiano/streamlit-pdf-viewer): a new streamlit component for visualising enhanced PDF documents.

At the moment a [special grobid version](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/pull/1068) is required. 

## Getting started

```shell
pip install -r requirements
```

**NOTE
**: Till this component will not be released, install it in the following way (if you don't have access, you can ask me lucanoro AT duck.com)

```shell
pip install -e git+https://github.com/lfoppiano/streamlit-pdf-viewer 
```
